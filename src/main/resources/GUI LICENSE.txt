The GUI and art elements for the GUI, (including the fxml files) are under a different license than the rest of the code,
this only matters if you intend on using all or part of the Origin codebase in your code or you wish to modify the existing
codebase and distribute it. If you plan on doing so, please read the license text at the top of the FXMLController.java file.
As it states, you must omit the GUI code and elements from your codebase.
